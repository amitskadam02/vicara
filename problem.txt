Question:2

Microcontroller unable tp read data from sensor MPU6050 possible reson are:

1.The MPU 6050 board is set to sleep mode by default.
  Add library for that .
2.check that you are using the correct I2C address (7-bit vs. 8-bit!)
3.verify that you indeed use the correct ports
   no SDA / SCL swap
   PSoC4 SCB block can only use some fixed pins for I2C
4.verify that on your board used pins are not connected to anything else 
5.verify the pull-up resistors (somewhere between 1k and 10k)
6.use either a oscilloscope or a logic analyzer to verify whats happening 
  on that lines.
7.try to reduce your code to the bare minimum, following the code examples
   and the data sheet, and try to read only the ID register (0x75).
